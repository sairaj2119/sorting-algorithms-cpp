- Count sort counts the occurance of a element in the unsorted array and uses extra space to store the count hence it is called as count or counting sort

* Count sort is usfull if we know the range of the elements of the unsorted array since we create an extra array of the maximum of the elements of the unsorted array

* the smaller the range of values faster and lesser space the algorithm takes
