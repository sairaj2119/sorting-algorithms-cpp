- In selection sort, the smallest element is exahanges with the first element of the unsorted list of elements (the exchanged element takes the place where smallest element is initially placed). Then the second smallest element is exchanged with the second element of the unsorted elements and so on until all the elements are sorted

- In place sort that is it requires no additional storage space

- Intermediate reuslts are usefull, that is after 1 pass smallest element is at 0 index of the unsorted array
