- Insertion sort algorithm picks elements one by one and places it to the right position where it belogs in the sorted list of elements, each iteration removes an element from the input list and inserts it tino the sorted sublist

- Sorting is implace that is it requires only a constand amount O(1) of additional memory space

- Insertion sort can sort the list as it receives it or inline sorting

- Insertion sort is stable i.e., it preserves the order of dublicate elements in the sorted array, it takes O(n+d), where d is the number of inversions

- Insertion sort is adaptable i.e., the time complexity improves if the array is partially sorted

- Intermediate results are not useful
